The Autonomous Litter Detection and Delivery System (ALDDS) is a capstone project aimed at developing an autonomous system for detecting and collecting litter in outdoor environments. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and robotics to identify and retrieve litter, contributing to the cleanliness and sustainability of public spaces.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation and exploration of outdoor environments
- Real-time litter detection using computer vision algorithms
- Efficient path planning for litter retrieval
- 3D printed Mantis-Claw for litter collection and delivery to designated bins
- User-friendly interface for system monitoring and control

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```git clone https://github.com/TLAndrewMarkDale/CapstoneII_Group15_ALDDS.git```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Set up the necessary hardware components, including the robot platform, sensors, and actuators.

4. Configure the system parameters in the `config.yaml` file.

## Usage
    1. Connect To Tello Drone
    2. Launch the ALDDS system: `ALDDS_gui.py`
2. Monitor the system's performance through the user interface.

3. Retrieve the collected litter from the designated bins.
